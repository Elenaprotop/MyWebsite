        <b>Hi! My Name is Elena.</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        I am a UX designer with a background in UX, UI, Graphic, Visual, and Web design.
        <br />
        In my design practice, I draw inspiration from music, and movies, as well as my personal
        <br />
        interests in the arts, and nature.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I am not working I usually cook for my family or spend time with my kids
        <br />
        so they can exercise their writing, listening, and coloring skills.
